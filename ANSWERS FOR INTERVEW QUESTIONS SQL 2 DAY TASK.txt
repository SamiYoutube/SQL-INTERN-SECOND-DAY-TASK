ANSWERS FOR INTERVEW QUESTIONS
-------------------------------------------

1. Difference between NULL and 0?

NULL = no value, unknown, or missing.

0 = a numeric value (zero).
They are not the same: NULL â‰  0.

2. What is a default constraint?
A default constraint provides an automatic value for a column when no value is supplied during INSERT.
Example:

Salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 30000.00


3. How does IS NULL work?
IS NULL checks whether a column contains a NULL value.

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Email IS NULL;


4. How do you update multiple rows?
Use UPDATE with a condition that matches multiple rows.

UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = Salary + 5000
WHERE Department = 'IT';


5. Can we insert partial values?
Yes âœ…, if the missing columns allow NULL or have DEFAULT values.

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName)
VALUES (5, 'Anita', 'Rao');


6. What happens if a NOT NULL field is left empty?
The query will fail with an error, because NOT NULL columns must always have a value.

7. How do you rollback a deletion?
If inside a transaction, use ROLLBACK:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 2;
ROLLBACK; -- undo deletion


ðŸ‘‰ If committed, rollback is not possible unless backups exist.

8. Can we insert values into specific columns only?
Yes âœ…, you must specify the column list:

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName)
VALUES (6, 'Vikram', 'Singh');


9. How to insert values using SELECT?
Use INSERT INTO â€¦ SELECT:

INSERT INTO EmployeesBackup (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Finance';


10. What is ON DELETE CASCADE?
Itâ€™s a referential action in a foreign key constraint.
When the parent row is deleted, all related child rows are also deleted automatically.

FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID) ON DELETE CASCADE
